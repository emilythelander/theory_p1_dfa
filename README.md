# Project 1: Deterministic Finite Automata
Authors: Emily Thelander, Spencer Pattillo
CS 361, Fall 2024

This program allows the user to create deterministic finite automata machines. Non-deterministic automata are not supported.
Users can add states, transitions, indicate start and final states, and declare an alphabet of character values.

Compiling/Running:
The 'driver' class is DFATest.java. It contains the JUnit test suite. To run, you can compile and run manually from
the command line, or you can use an IDE like VSC that allows easy support for JUnit testing.
